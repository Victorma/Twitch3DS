#Random informations

Use a video with dimensions multiple of 8 for best performance !

Videos up to 1024x1024 are supported (but eh, that won't run fullspeed you know)
- Actually only if width < 800 if you set up the framebuffers to be using RGBA

Prefer simple MPEG4 to H.264 ! (H.264 is  ~4 times slower)
 
Some stats (video only, old 3ds) :

* 400x240 mpeg4 -> 37fps
* 400x240 h264  -> 16fps

The new3ds is way faster
